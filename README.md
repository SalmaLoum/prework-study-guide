# Salma's bowl of code potpourri
> AKA Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As this course starts, finding out what use for note taking purposes has been a dilemma. I searched high and low for a place to store code snippets, notes, hot keys, etc. but nothing showed promise.
Although, this is a required project, and my hands are tied here; this will serve as a place to hold the best and worst of my code collection, like a bowl of code potpourri. 
I was curious about the difficulty of this course and having a step by step guide helpped ease that anxiety. Doing the Prework helped set the tone for my expectations of learning pace, time management, and educational style.

*If anyone is reading this [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and [Xmind](https://xmind.app/) are great for code note taking purposes.*
